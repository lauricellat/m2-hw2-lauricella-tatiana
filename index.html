    <h1>Introduction Website</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my first HTML website!</h2>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Tatiana Lauricella and I live in Naples, FL. I live in sunny Naples with my husband, Dave. I attended the University of Florida from 2012-2017. During this time, I earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Special Education and a Master’s Degree in Early Childhood Education. After graduation I began a career as a 1st grade special education teacher mostly serving students with Autism. At the start of my 5th year teaching (and the peak of Covid-19) my career quickly shifted from a special education teacher to an e-learning teacher. Initially, the thought of having to recalibrate my well-prepared lesson plans and relationships with my students was difficult to manage. Having to totally alter not only the method that students retained knowledge, but the platform and resources they used to learn was an overwhelming. However, this unexpected turn created an imperative opportunity for me to reinvent my technical skills and redefine my professional path, which led me to find a new opportunity outside the classroom. I now hold the position of a Sr. Learning Experience Designer (LXD) developing online learning content for a global construction rental corporation. In my current role I create online courses in Storyline 360 & Rise 360, manage our online LMS, and dabble with website management. I have zero experience with coding, but I am excited to learn!</p>
    <h4>My Hobbies</h4>
        <p>Working full time and going back to school has left limited time for hobbies, but I try my best to fit them in when I can!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding new nature trails and walking paths</li>
        <li>Spending time with my family</li>
        <li>Reading- I prefer non-fiction and autobiographies</li>
      </ul>  
    <h4>My Interests</h4>
      <p>I have two main interests that I would consider more passions that hobbies. My two passions are cooking and makeup. 
        <p>I grew up around food my whole life and learning amazing recipes from my Italian family. Below is a link to my favorite webiste for finding new recipes! </p>

      <p>My second passion is makeup. I am a part-time freelance makeup artist. As a creative outlet I create makeup video content on Instagram and Tiktok. My favorite place to get makeup is at Sephora- see link below.  </p>

    <h4>My Career Goals</h4>
    <p>I have two career goals. One I consider the dream goal -makeup- and one the more practical goal -LXD-. I hope I can find success in both! </p>
